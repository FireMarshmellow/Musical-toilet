# Musical-toilet
 This repository contains the code and instructions for a unique MellowLabs project: turning a toilet into a musical instrument. This project was made possible by the support of our Patreon community and showcases the use of an ESP32 microcontroller, capacitive touch sensor, and an audio board to create a unique and humorous bathroom experience.
